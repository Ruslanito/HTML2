        type - Specifies the type of button you want and takes one of the following values: submit , reset , or button . <br> name - Provides a name for the button. You need to add only a name attribute to a button if there is more than one button on
        the same form. (In which case it helps to indicate which of the buttons was clicked.) It is considered good practice, however, to give the button a name anyway to provide an indication of what the button does. <br> value - Enables you to specify
        what the text on the button should read. If a name attribute is given, the value of the value attribute is sent to the server as part of the name/ value pair for this form control. If no value is given, then no name/value pair is sent for this
        button.
