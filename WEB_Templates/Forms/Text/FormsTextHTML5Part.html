   <p>In addition to the new &lt;input&gt; types, the new HTML specification added several completely new form elements. This section introduces three of the most useful: &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, and &lt;datalist&gt;. The others are &lt;output&gt;
      for the output of mathematical exercises or other calculations and &lt;keygen&gt;, which is used with cryptography.

   <p>Track Completion of a Task with the New &lt;progress&gt; Element </p>
   <p>The &lt;progress&gt; element is designed to represent the progress through a task. For example, you could use &lt;progress&gt; to track the amount of a file downloaded or the percentage of a survey completed. In addition to the global attributes youâ€™ve
      already learned about, &lt;progress&gt; also makes specific use of two attributes to craft the display.
   </p>
   <p>- max - indicates the maximum value of the &lt;progress&gt; element.</p>
   <p>- value - indicates the amount completed.</p>
